# Codenames

[Codenames](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codenames_(board_game)>) is a board game for 4-8 people. The traditional version is played when everybody is at the same spot, but in this modern world, when are people together? This digital version allows you to play with your friends whether you are sitting on the same couch, or on opposite sides of the globe. Additionally, since it works on desktop _and_ mobile devices, you can play on the go.
